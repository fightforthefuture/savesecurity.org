      title: Backdoors Threaten Our Safety
      description_html: |
        <p>
        Encryption is a basic form of security, like a lock on the front door of your house.  
        It protects valuable digital information — everything from personal communications and 
        bank account passwords to air traffic control systems and nuclear power plant controls.
        The US Department of Justice is

      title: Encryption Is Under Attack
      description_html: |
        <p>
        Attorney General William Barr is 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-QQwv1U2aY"
        target=_blank">urging</a> tech companies to break end-to-end encryption services by creating 
        digital backdoors that will grant law enforcement agencies access to all electronic services. 
        But placing digital backdoors in every commercial device invites hackers to target everything 
        from smart doorbells and self-driving cars to hospitals and air traffic control centers.

        <br>
        <p>
        In the past, ackers have used our own digital backdoors to interfere with 
        <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/12/researchers-solve-the-juniper-mystery-and-they-say-its-partially-the-nsas-fault/"
        target=_blank">communication systems</a>, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petya_(malware)"
        target=_blank">power grids</a>, and 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"
        target=_blank">nuclear facilities</a>.
        That's why the former chief of the National Security Administration has 
        <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/michael-hayden-encryption-apple-2016-2"
        target=_blank">warned</a> that breaking encryption makes everyone less safe. And yet, Attorney 
        General Barr still doesn’t get it.
        </p>
        
    disaster:
      title: A Disaster Waiting to Happen
      description_html: |
        <p>
        Encryption relies on complicated math equations to effectively hide data from prying eyes. Even 
        if the Department of Justice manages to legally compel tech companies to break the encryption 
        services they use, anyone with math and programming skills can simply 
        <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/07/australian-pm-calls-end-end-encryption-ban-says-laws-mathematics-dont-apply-down"
        target=_blank">create their own</a> encryption systems. Sufficiently-motivated bad actors 
        will still be able to communicate in secret, while the rest of us will be left more vulnerable 
        than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
        And it isn’t just state-sponsored terrorists or malicious hackers we should be worried about.  
        If Barr gets his way, your emails, text messages, computer files, phone calls — literally everything 
        you say and do online — will be put at risk. Law enforcement agents frequently 
        <a href="https://apnews.com/699236946e3140659fff8a2362e16f43"
        target=_blank">abuse</a> digital surveillance systems to stalk their romantic interests, snoop on 
        neighbors, and harass journalists. And corporations have a
        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18214667/att-t-mobile-sprint-location-tracking-data-bounty-hunters"
        target=_blank">history</a> of selling access to your sensitive information for their profit.      
        Providing these people with even greater access into our online activities is certain result in 
        greater abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
        Digital backdoors are a disaster waiting to happen, plain and simple. Privacy is a 
        <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/DigitalAge/Pages/DigitalAgeIndex.aspx"
        target=_blank">fundamental human right</a> around the world, and it has been recognized by the 
        United States Supreme Court as 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._Connecticut"
        target=_blank">the law of the land</a>. Let’s make sure it stays that way.
