      title: Backdoors threaten our safety
      description_html: |
        <p>Encryption is a basic form of security, like a lock on the front door of your house.  
        It protects valuable digital information — everything from personal communications and 
        bank account passwords to air traffic control systems and nuclear power plant controls.
        The US Department of Justice is

      title: What's Happening?
      description_html: |
        Right now, governments around the world are threatening the right to use encryption—the very basis for online privacy and security. Senators Feinstein and Burr have introduced legislation banning encryption in the US. In the UK, the Investigatory Powers bill could mandate encryption backdoors. And in Brazil, judges have already briefly blocked WhatsApp for it’s security measures - even arresting an employee. At a time when everything from critical infrastructure to bank accounts is at more risk of being hacked than ever, it’s hard to imagine a more backwards idea than banning encryption and requiring backdoors. After all, security experts agree that backdoors make us more vulnerable. Still, a loss in just one major country could shift technology choices everywhere. We need to win this debate once and for all. We're planning to seize every teachable moment to educate the public about the importance of encryption; to provide the tools that can be used to advocate reform; and to build a large and diverse coalition that includes allies across the political spectrum as well as a cadre of organizations and businesses.

        <p>Engineers use consumer products or apps with encryption to maintain the most sensitive systems on the planet. Hospitals. Air traffic control. Nuclear power. Threatening the right to use encryption puts lives at risk, by undermining security everywhere.</p>
