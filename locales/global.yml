      I'm calling to ask my lawmakers to SAVE SECURITY.  Please support strong, commercially available end-to-end encryption and oppose any efforts to create dangerous digital backdoors. Thank you.

      Encryption keeps us safe. Backdoors put everyone in danger and threaten our basic rights.

      Tell Attorney General Barr and the Department of Justice to STOP trying to break encryption!
